and shifted all the environment variables in it 

mongodb cloud par jakar 
quick start me ek database bnalo 
or IP Address daina 0.0.0.0             (0.0.0.0 means accessible from anywhere)
this is not good practice 
And in production we only give IP Address of server (where our server is situated)

connection string password or database name enter kar dena
